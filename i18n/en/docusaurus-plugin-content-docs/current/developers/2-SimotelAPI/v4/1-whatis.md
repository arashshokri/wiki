# Introduction to Simotel API

SA is a collection of APIs that are initiated by sending a request from the web service to Simotel. This service is created using the standard RestAPI format. For example, by sending a two-way call request from the web service to Simotel, the contact center will begin to establish the two-way call once the request is received.
